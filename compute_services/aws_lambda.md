# AWS Lambda

## Overview
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume.

## Key Features
- Serverless compute
- Automatic scaling
- Event-driven execution
- Supports multiple languages (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)

## Common Use Cases
- Real-time file processing
- Data transformation
- Backend for web and mobile apps
- Automation and scheduled tasks

## Example Usage
1. Write a Lambda function in the AWS Console or upload your code.
2. Set up a trigger (e.g., S3 event, API Gateway, CloudWatch Events).
3. Lambda executes your code in response to the trigger.
