# AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Overview
AWS IAM enables you to securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. You can create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.

## Key Features
- Fine-grained access control
- Role-based access and temporary credentials
- Policy management (JSON-based)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Integration with AWS Organizations

## Common Use Cases
- User and group management
- Secure API and CLI access
- Cross-account access
- Least privilege enforcement

## Example Usage
1. Create IAM users, groups, and roles in the AWS Console.
2. Attach policies to control access to resources.
3. Enable MFA for enhanced security.
4. Use roles for EC2, Lambda, and cross-account access.
